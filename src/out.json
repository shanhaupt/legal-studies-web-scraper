            "article-content": "in response to intensifying attempts by major corporate interests, including the alcohol and tobacco lobby, to involve themselves in conversations around the federal regulation of marijuana, kassandra frederique, executive director of the drug policy alliance, released the following statement: “we have long been concerned about the entry of large commercial interests into the legal marijuana market. big alcohol and tobacco have an abysmal track record of using predatory tactics to sell their products and build their brands – often targeting low-income communities of color and fighting public health regulations that would protect people. it is predictable, but reprehensible, that industries that have allowed the arbitrary distinction between licit and illicit drugs to stand for so long now want to end a form of prohibition in order to bolster their bottom line. they stood by for decades as communities of color were criminalized and robbed of economic opportunities, only to try to swoop in when it is politically and financially convenient to do so, to deprive these communities once more of the long overdue economic benefits they stand to gain. we believe that federal marijuana prohibition needs to end. we also believe that regulation needs to be done thoughtfully in ways that begin to repair past harm and make communities safer and healthier. we do not want to replicate tobacco and alcohol industry strategies, which we know have hurt the health and wellness of communities. we urge caution to elected officials in taking these industry actors’ counsel and demand that the communities who have borne the brunt of prohibition be given the right-of-way when it comes to shaping policy and benefiting from the legal regulation of marijuana.\" "

            "article-content": "portland, or – in a dramatic recognition of the urgency of providing treatment, health and harm reduction services in conjunction with the all-drug decriminalization provisions outlined in measure 110 that went into effect february 1, the oregon joint ways & means committee voted friday to provide $20 million in up-front funding. the funding approval comes more than three months ahead of schedule, as the deadline specified in the measure to begin distributing funds is june 30. once approved by the full legislature, the funding will be added to the $7.8 million that was already deposited into the drug treatment and recovery services fund (created through measure 110) from the mckinsey & company opioid settlement at the beginning of february. “we thank the oregon legislature for recognizing the urgent need to provide people with health and harm reduction services as outlined in measure 110 and supported by over 58.5% of voters in the state,” said theshia naidoo, managing director of legal affairs at the drug policy alliance. “what we know is that expansion of services goes hand in hand with successful decriminalization policies. we’ve seen increased access to health services be the key to success in other countries that have implemented some form of decriminalization, such as portugal and switzerland, and we know that it will hold true here as well.” the proposal passed out of committee friday and is headed for a full floor vote in the house, where it is expected to pass. due to the emergency clause contained within the bill, funds will be made immediately available, thereby allowing the oregon health authority to quickly distribute them to community-based organizations throughout the state, which can begin providing services. “the health justice recovery alliance has been working closely with lawmakers to urgently address oregon’s addiction crisis,” said tera hurst, executive director of the health justice recovery alliance. “before the pandemic, oregon was already in the midst of an addiction crisis. what we’re seeing now is providers having to shutter operations and reduce staff and programs, all during a time when people need these services now more than ever before. the need for funding is overwhelming, and this $20 million will help ensure that providers can serve the most vulnerable individuals in our community.” providers from across the state have weighed in to share how emergency funds can help them meet the tremendous need for services across the state: “people with addictions are having an especially hard time during this pandemic, and this money can help us provide additional harm reduction-centered overdose prevention education, and facilitate access to naloxone so that we can keep people safe.” - haven wheelock, mph, overdose prevention specialist at outside in. “these funds can help us address the racist war on drugs’ disproportionate impact on black, latinx, native and tribal communities by providing housing for black individuals transitioning out of incarceration, and allowing us to hire additional peer support specialists to help people in their recovery journey.” - larry turner, executive director, fresh out “our community was hit hard by the wildfires last summer; hundreds of individuals, including many living in affordable housing units, have been displaced. more people in our community are using substances to cope with the trauma of this experience, and need the services treatment organizations provide. these funds can help house up to 120 southern oregon residents who are struggling with substance use disorder to aid them in their journey to recovery.” - lori paris, president & ceo of addictions recovery center in medford “this funding would allow us to provide stable, safe, sober housing for up to 25 individuals struggling with addiction in our rural communities. we can work quickly to meet the need by increasing capacity within agencies already integrated in our communities.” - amy ashton-williams, executive director of oregon washington health network, which operates in union, umatilla, morrow counties in oregon and in walla walla county in washington last november, oregon voters made history by passing measure 110, the drug addiction treatment & recovery act, which decriminalized personal possession of all drugs and expanded access to evidence-based, culturally-competent treatment, harm reduction and other health services, peer support and recovery services, and even housing and job assistance. the effort was spearheaded by drug policy action, the advocacy and political arm of the drug policy alliance.

            "article-content": "new york, ny – in response to the biden administration terminating the employment of staffers due to admissions of past marijuana use despite previous conflicting statements saying they would not, kassandra frederique, executive director of the drug policy alliance (dpa), released the following statement: “change starts at the top. the majority of the policies we have in place today that consistently deny employment to people for drug use, arrests or convictions—and disproportionately impact people of color—started with the federal government. when ronald reagan escalated the war on drugs in 1986, one of the initiatives he announced his administration would undertake was ensuring ‘a drug-free workplace at all levels of government and in the private sector.’ these policies have not only failed to reduce drug use or improve safety, but instead actually prevent people from seeking assistance for their substance use out of fear of negative repercussions from their employers. and now, for decades, the drug war has infiltrated workplace policies with drug testing and drug record discrimination. these exclusionary policies have robbed people of their livelihoods and denied them one of the primary and critical factors associated with a reduction in drug use and potential negative consequences of drug use — access to stable employment. the flawed and discriminatory idea that people who use drugs cannot be good employees was planted at the very inception of the modern drug war despite any evidence connecting drug use to poor job performance. and that idea unfortunately persists, impacting employment policies - from the white house to the local fast food joint and everything in between. the biden administration announcing that past marijuana use would not be a factor in employment and then, just weeks later, turning around and terminating and denying employment because of that very factor sets a very dangerous precedent. we urge president biden to stop reverting back to the harmful policies that have robbed so many people of their livelihoods, and instead, end this cycle once and for all.” dpa recently launched uprooting the drug war, a major new initiative that analyzes six different systems through first-hand stories, data spotlights, and reports that take a deep dive into how drug war policies have taken root and created grave harm in the fields of education, employment, housing, child welfare, immigration, and public benefits.

            "article-content": "santa fe, nm – in the waning hours of the regular session, the new mexico state legislature failed to pass cannabis legalization. however, governor lujan grisham has indicated that a special session will likely be held in the coming weeks to address legalization. in response to this, emily kaltenbach, senior director for resident states and new mexico for the drug policy alliance, released the following statement: \"while we are disappointed that new mexicans will have to wait a little bit longer to reap the benefits and justice cannabis legalization will provide—especially to hispanic/latinx, black, native and indigenous communities, who have been disproportionately impacted by prohibition—after the legislature failed to pass house bill 12 this session, we applaud governor lujan grisham for acknowledging this cannot wait and indicating she will take up legalization in a special session. and though we are experiencing this unfortunate setback, we are so grateful for the leadership of representatives andrea romero, deborah armstrong, and javier martinez this session in prioritizing racial justice and equity provisions, public health safeties, and medical cannabis patient protections in their legislation. it is clear why hb 12, out of many other pieces of legislation, was the cannabis legalization bill that made it the farthest this session.” as new mexico considers the end of cannabis prohibition, the drug policy alliance believes that any legislation that moves forward in the special session should be comprehensive and contain these key provisions: equity in the new marketplace by allowing individuals with prior cannabis convictions to work and be licensed in the new industry and by creating a microbusiness license, creating an opportunity for small new mexico businesses to enter the marketplace. protections for the use of cannabis, including prohibiting police from stopping and searching an individual or vehicle based on the smell of cannabis alone, no denial of public benefits or health care based on cannabis use or a positive cannabis drug test or removing or placement into state custody of a child; denial of custody or visitation; and, presumption of neglect of child endangerment based on the use of cannabis alone. reinvesting a portion of revenue generated by cannabis sales back into communities most harmed by unfair enforcement of cannabis laws. protecting medical cannabis patients by investing a portion of cannabis revenue into a subsidy fund to support low-income medical cannabis patients and eliminating grt on medical cannabis sales. allowing personal cultivation (home grow) of a small number of plants for recreational use. background in december, 2020, the u.s. house of representatives passed the marijuana opportunity reinvestment & expungement (more) act that frames cannabis reform as a racial justice and equity mandate. the more act was the first piece of comprehensive cannabis reform legislation that decriminalizes marijuana—and the only one centered in reparative justice—to pass either chamber of congress. arizona and new jersey passed legalization proposals this past year that center equity and racial justice as well, with new york considering similar legislation in their current session. nearly three out of four new mexicans approve of cannabis legalization with provisions in place to ensure tax revenue is reinvested back into communities, including 94% of democrats, 93% of independents and 46% of republicans.

            "article-content": "santa fe, nm – with the senate judiciary committee voting in favor of cannabis legalization, emily kaltenbach, senior director for resident states and new mexico for the drug policy alliance, released the following statement: “as the clock begins to run out on an attempt to pass cannabis legalization this year, yesterday’s passage of house bill 12 by the senate judiciary committee made it clear that legislators have heard the call of their constituents and chosen to put politics aside to prioritize new mexico families over big business. with hb 12 overcoming this major hurdle, it now moves to a senate floor vote and could end up on the governor’s desk by saturday. new mexicans are absolutely ready to see marijuana legalization become a reality in the state, but they have made it clear that repairing the damage done by the drug war is non-negotiable. hb 12 is the best vehicle to do this, as it reinvests back into communities most harmed by drug prohibition, particularly hispanic/latino, black and native populations in new mexico.” as new mexico considers the end of cannabis prohibition, any legislation that moves forward in new mexico should be comprehensive and contain these key provisions: equity in the new marketplace allow individuals with prior cannabis convictions to work in the new cannabis industry and to apply and receive a license. create a microbusiness license that would be given priority to be licensed first, creating an opportunity for small new mexico businesses to enter the marketplace while requiring other licensing fees to be scaled on the size of the business. require the state to create a social and economic plan to encourage diversity in licensing. authorize the executive to enter into intergovernmental agreements with indian nations, tribes, and pueblos regarding the implementation and compliance in connection with legalization. protections for the use of cannabis prohibit police from stopping and searching an individual or vehicle based on the smell of cannabis alone. no denial of public benefits or health care based on cannabis use or a positive cannabis drug test. prohibit prior cannabis convictions to bar anyone from licensure or employment of any kind. conduct allowed under the new law shall not in itself constitute grounds for intervention, removal or placement into state custody of a child; denial of custody or visitation; and, presumption of neglect of child endangerment. community reinvestment invest a significant portion of revenue generated by cannabis sales back into communities most harmed by unfair enforcement of cannabis laws through the creation of a community reinvestment fund. one-time allocation from cannabis sales to fund an upgrade to the state’s criminal justice data system to allow for automatic expungement and resentencing of past cannabis convictions. protecting medical cannabis patients invest a portion of cannabis revenue into a subsidy fund to support low-income medical cannabis patients. eliminate grt on medical cannabis sales. protecting the public’s health fund a public education campaign that educates the community about the potential harms of use and educates adults on responsible use. limit advertising and marketing and include packaging restrictions to the greatest extent possible to restrict exposure to minors. reducing criminalization automatically expunging records of people with past cannabis convictions and resentencing and releasing people who are currently incarcerated, on probation, parole, or under supervision for cannabis convictions. create a reasonable penalty structure for remaining and new penalties. create civil fines instead of criminal penalties where appropriate. allow personal cultivation (home grow) of a small number of plants for recreational use. background in december, 2020, the u.s. house of representatives passed the marijuana opportunity reinvestment & expungement (more) act that frames cannabis reform as a racial justice and equity mandate. the more act was the first piece of comprehensive cannabis reform legislation that decriminalizes marijuana—and the only one centered in reparative justice—to pass either chamber of congress. arizona and new jersey passed legalization proposals this past year that center equity and racial justice as well, with new york considering similar legislation in their current session. nearly three out of four new mexicans approve of cannabis legalization with provisions in place to ensure tax revenue is reinvested back into communities, including 94% of democrats, 93% of independents and 46% of republicans.

            "article-content": "los angeles, ca – today, the drug policy alliance released the impact of the overdose crisis on the latino community in california, new research that uncovers the often-overlooked impact of the overdose crisis on the latino population in california. dpa commissioned the study--conducted by dr. avelardo valdez, a professor and researcher at the university of southern california’s suzanne dworak-peck school of social work--and helped draft concrete policy recommendations to help mitigate the rise in overdoses among this community. “while overdose deaths among the latino population have historically been lower than other racial and ethnic groups in the united states, we are starting to see a very troubling trend that suggests a sharp rate of increase. these groups have been largely overlooked when it comes to providing access to resources to curb the overdose crisis, and intervention is urgently needed to avoid a health emergency,” said jeannette zanipatin, director of dpa’s california policy office. “this research is a canary in the coal mine warning us that it’s time to wake up and ensure latino populations in california—and across the country--receive the same attention that has been paid to other communities to protect against vulnerability to increasing overdose rates.” in particular, this research uncovered some startling trends, including: nationally: in 2017, the latino overall drug overdose rate was roughly half of the national rate (10.6 vs. 21.7 per 100,000), yet this rate increased by 158% from 2014 to 2017. illicit opioids are driving overdose deaths among latinos. in 2017, fentanyl was the most commonly involved drug in overdose deaths among latinos (40.2% of overdose deaths), followed by heroin (31.2%), and cocaine (26.8%). in california: the opioid-involved overdose death rate for latinos in california nearly doubled between 2016 and 2019 (2.59 to 5.07 per 100,000). prescription opioids have contributed to the majority of latino overdose deaths in california since at least 2006. while the rate was stable for a decade, it increased by 138% between 2015 and 2019 (1.57 to 3.75 per 100,000). fentanyl-involved overdose deaths increased 35-fold between 2013 and 2019 (from 0.08 to 2.82 per 100,000), and fentanyl replaced heroin as the second most-involved drug in overdose deaths in 2018. methamphetamine-involved overdoses appear to be increasing and may overtake heroin in coming years. when the data is broken down by county in california, the impacts are even harsher. the research found that the overdose rates in lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada and mendocino counties were significantly higher than the state or national average. simply looking at state-level statistics has historically not shown the full extent of harm. the brief outlines key policy recommendations that should be considered in order to mitigate the consequences of the overdose crisis and its impacts on latino communities in california and more broadly. some of the recommendations include: authorizing overdose prevention programs in california at the state and local level, especially where the overdose rates are high such as lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada, and mendocino counties and other vulnerable communities; promoting federal, state, and local legislation to decriminalize personal possession of small amounts of drugs while expanding access to substance use and health services; supporting federal action to make medication for addiction treatment for opioid use disorders (mat), especially methadone and buprenorphine, more accessible by removing the x waiver requirements for prescribing buprenorphine; increasing access to naloxone and mat through private insurance and the state’s drug medi-cal program, including requiring both doctors to co-prescribe and pharmacists to co-dispense naloxone to latino patients with opioid prescriptions; increasing local funding and prioritization of community-based health services and mobile naloxone distribution for people at risk of opioid-related harms, especially in latino vulnerable communities and in high-risk counties; expanding county and city authorized syringe service programs, which are vital access points for naloxone, and fentanyl testing strips with a special focus in lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada and mendocino counties; increasing spanish-speaking staff, including front-line personnel, in harm reduction and syringe exchange programs that are able to connect directly with community members and increase trust within the latino community for harm reduction organizations; partnering with existing and new efforts to relaunch a latino-centric approach and community education campaign on the safe use of opioids and overdose training programming, including the use of naloxone at the county and state level. the full brief and complete list of policy recommendations can be found here.

            "article-content": "new york, ny – a new report released today by the drug policy alliance and the public science project at the graduate center, cuny, inequitable marijuana criminalization, covid-19, and socioeconomic disparities: the case for community reinvestment in new york, shows deep racial disparities and economic impacts in marijuana arrests across the state of new york. four specific case studies document how, despite regional differences, people of color in new york city, new rochelle, syracuse, and buffalo are consistently over-represented in marijuana arrests, and areas with the highest marijuana arrest rates also tend to have proportionally larger populations of color, according to the report. across all cities, there were also higher covid-19 positivity rates among the high marijuana arrest zip codes compared to the low marijuana arrest zip codes. “the enforcement of marijuana prohibition has devastated communities across new york state, primarily communities of color and low-income communities. there have been more than 800,000 arrests for low-level marijuana just in the last 25 years alone in new york, with extreme racial disparities – despite data showing similar rates of use and sale across racial and ethnic populations,” said melissa moore, new york state director, drug policy alliance. “in light of this new report, new york has the opportunity to pass the most ambitious marijuana legalization bill in the country, setting the national model for marijuana legalization by centering reinvestment, equity, and justice within our comprehensive reform. let’s get this done right.” in each city, selected to represent different regions, as well as economic, educational, and racial diversity within the state, the average poverty rate was significantly higher among the high marijuana arrest zip codes and the high marijuana arrest zip codes consistently have nearly half the median household income of the low marijuana arrest zip codes – except for new rochelle, where the disparity is even greater. the average percentage of families receiving snap (supplemental nutrition assistance program) in high marijuana arrest zip codes was at least three times greater than in low marijuana arrest zip codes. in addition, every high marijuana arrest zip code had both lower rates of home ownerships and lower median home values than low marijuana arrest zip codes. in buffalo, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest zip codes is 68 times higher than that of the low arrest zip codes, and there were 3 times as many marijuana arrests of black people as there were of white people. in syracuse, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest zip codes is 8.8 times higher than that of the low arrest zip codes and there were 4 times as many arrests of black, asian, and native american people as there were of white people between 2010-2020, with black people comprising 80% of all marijuana arrests. in new rochelle, the arrest rate in the high marijuana arrest zip code is 7.5 times more than the low arrest zip code and black people comprise 45.8% of all marijuana arrests between 2018-jan 2021 despite being 20.1% of new rochelle’s population. in nyc, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest precincts is 15 times higher than that of the low marijuana arrest precincts. in marijuana arrests between 2010 and august of 2019, there were 8 times as many arrests of black and latinx people as there were of white people. the extreme racial disparities in new york’s marijuana arrest crusade, as detailed in the case studies in this report, are the result of targeted criminalization and structural racism – and the same factors that have driven the marijuana arrest crusade have also resulted in generational wealth impacts. now, as this report shows, there are also extreme disparities in the impact of covid-19 in the same neighborhoods. “legalizing marijuana cannot be done justly in new york without an adequate plan for atonement for the devastation caused to black and brown people during the decades-long war on drugs,\" said stanley fritz, political director at citizen action of new york. \"this report makes clear the link between being a person of color, economic status and mass criminalization. the consequence for our community is disproportionate deaths, infection rates, joblessness and housing insecurity during the pandemic. legislators will miss the mark to pass truly equitable legislation if they do not vote on the mrta.\" “decades of criminalization during new york’s marijuana arrest crusade have impacted people’s ability to secure housing, employment, and higher education, further exacerbating challenges marginalized communities faced before the pandemic and compounding efforts to survive amid the covid-19 crisis. the same communities targeted by the war on drugs are the ones with the least access to health care right now, the ones grappling with decades of the economic toll from criminalization, with low wages, unstable housing, and the ones losing jobs and loved ones at the same time. the structural factors at play are wholly intertwined – and they cannot be ignored any longer,” according to the report’s foreword. legalization provides an opportunity to invest a significant portion of marijuana tax revenue in the communities that bore the worst of marijuana criminalization and are now deeply impacted by covid-19. both the drug policy alliance and the public science project at the graduate center, cuny support the comprehensive marijuana reform and taxation act (mrta), which is the gold standard reform bill in the legislature. it provides strong community reinvestment and social equity provisions, comprehensively addresses prior criminalization, and has a balanced governance structure for the office of cannabis management. \"at a time when our government must find ways to reduce placing people in confined spaces because of the pandemic, police find ways to target marijuana arrests in vulnerable people of color neighborhoods. this is insanity. stop criminalizing people of color. pass the mrta!\" said juan cartagena, president & general counsel, latinojustice prldef “our ability to support the health of minority communities who’ve suffered disproportionately from cannabis criminalization, as well as our ability to create businesses and jobs within the cannabis industry, is an opportunity that should not be squandered. additional research from the national institutes of health shows high levels of trauma and ptsd among african-american people in urban areas, and if we were to focus specifically on the trauma and ptsd of those incarcerated for marijuana crimes, those numbers would skyrocket. new york must pass legalization that addresses these lifelong impacts,” said adrian adams, ed.d., minorities for medical marijuana. \"this report is simply an empirical recognition of what black and brown people across nys have known for years,\" said jawanza james williams, director of organizing from vocal-ny, \"the only appropriate response to this reality is the immediate legalization of cannabis through the mrta, with robust economic and social reinvestment into the communities most harmed; anything, short of that is at best racist by negligence, and a willful disregard of black lives.\" “it is often misconstrued that the war on drugs was 'failed,' yet we know all too well that it has been intricately designed to result in ways that have funneled black and brown and indigenous new yorkers into the carceral state. in syracuse - a city with the highest concentrated poverty among blacks and latinos nationwide, one of the most segregated school borders in nys, and with an underfunded school district - as all across the state, this war has disproportionately destroyed families and communities of color, fulfilling its intended and designed outcome. the era for race neutral policies to solve racially biased ones is over! the only way to remedy the harm of marijuana prohibition is to design for racial justice at the core. new york has an opportunity to do right by the communities that have been devastated by the war on drugs, and the mrta is an important step towards achieving those goals,” said yusuf abdul-qadir, syracuse police accountability and reform coalition. “these findings reveal how stark and concentrated the disparities are in communities of color,” said dr. brett stoudt, associate professor in the psychology doctoral program at the cuny graduate center and associate director of the public science project. “we need comprehensive legislation like mrta now more than ever because covid-19 has only served to heighten the severity of this deeply entrenched and structural precarity.” "

            "article-content": "portland, or – in a dramatic recognition of the urgency of providing treatment, health and harm reduction services in conjunction with the all-drug decriminalization provisions outlined in measure 110 that went into effect february 1, the oregon joint ways & means committee voted friday to provide $20 million in up-front funding. the funding approval comes more than three months ahead of schedule, as the deadline specified in the measure to begin distributing funds is june 30. once approved by the full legislature, the funding will be added to the $7.8 million that was already deposited into the drug treatment and recovery services fund (created through measure 110) from the mckinsey & company opioid settlement at the beginning of february. “we thank the oregon legislature for recognizing the urgent need to provide people with health and harm reduction services as outlined in measure 110 and supported by over 58.5% of voters in the state,” said theshia naidoo, managing director of legal affairs at the drug policy alliance. “what we know is that expansion of services goes hand in hand with successful decriminalization policies. we’ve seen increased access to health services be the key to success in other countries that have implemented some form of decriminalization, such as portugal and switzerland, and we know that it will hold true here as well.” the proposal passed out of committee friday and is headed for a full floor vote in the house, where it is expected to pass. due to the emergency clause contained within the bill, funds will be made immediately available, thereby allowing the oregon health authority to quickly distribute them to community-based organizations throughout the state, which can begin providing services. “the health justice recovery alliance has been working closely with lawmakers to urgently address oregon’s addiction crisis,” said tera hurst, executive director of the health justice recovery alliance. “before the pandemic, oregon was already in the midst of an addiction crisis. what we’re seeing now is providers having to shutter operations and reduce staff and programs, all during a time when people need these services now more than ever before. the need for funding is overwhelming, and this $20 million will help ensure that providers can serve the most vulnerable individuals in our community.” providers from across the state have weighed in to share how emergency funds can help them meet the tremendous need for services across the state: “people with addictions are having an especially hard time during this pandemic, and this money can help us provide additional harm reduction-centered overdose prevention education, and facilitate access to naloxone so that we can keep people safe.” - haven wheelock, mph, overdose prevention specialist at outside in. “these funds can help us address the racist war on drugs’ disproportionate impact on black, latinx, native and tribal communities by providing housing for black individuals transitioning out of incarceration, and allowing us to hire additional peer support specialists to help people in their recovery journey.” - larry turner, executive director, fresh out “our community was hit hard by the wildfires last summer; hundreds of individuals, including many living in affordable housing units, have been displaced. more people in our community are using substances to cope with the trauma of this experience, and need the services treatment organizations provide. these funds can help house up to 120 southern oregon residents who are struggling with substance use disorder to aid them in their journey to recovery.” - lori paris, president & ceo of addictions recovery center in medford “this funding would allow us to provide stable, safe, sober housing for up to 25 individuals struggling with addiction in our rural communities. we can work quickly to meet the need by increasing capacity within agencies already integrated in our communities.” - amy ashton-williams, executive director of oregon washington health network, which operates in union, umatilla, morrow counties in oregon and in walla walla county in washington last november, oregon voters made history by passing measure 110, the drug addiction treatment & recovery act, which decriminalized personal possession of all drugs and expanded access to evidence-based, culturally-competent treatment, harm reduction and other health services, peer support and recovery services, and even housing and job assistance. the effort was spearheaded by drug policy action, the advocacy and political arm of the drug policy alliance.

            "article-content": "los angeles, ca – today, the drug policy alliance released the impact of the overdose crisis on the latino community in california, new research that uncovers the often-overlooked impact of the overdose crisis on the latino population in california. dpa commissioned the study--conducted by dr. avelardo valdez, a professor and researcher at the university of southern california’s suzanne dworak-peck school of social work--and helped draft concrete policy recommendations to help mitigate the rise in overdoses among this community. “while overdose deaths among the latino population have historically been lower than other racial and ethnic groups in the united states, we are starting to see a very troubling trend that suggests a sharp rate of increase. these groups have been largely overlooked when it comes to providing access to resources to curb the overdose crisis, and intervention is urgently needed to avoid a health emergency,” said jeannette zanipatin, director of dpa’s california policy office. “this research is a canary in the coal mine warning us that it’s time to wake up and ensure latino populations in california—and across the country--receive the same attention that has been paid to other communities to protect against vulnerability to increasing overdose rates.” in particular, this research uncovered some startling trends, including: nationally: in 2017, the latino overall drug overdose rate was roughly half of the national rate (10.6 vs. 21.7 per 100,000), yet this rate increased by 158% from 2014 to 2017. illicit opioids are driving overdose deaths among latinos. in 2017, fentanyl was the most commonly involved drug in overdose deaths among latinos (40.2% of overdose deaths), followed by heroin (31.2%), and cocaine (26.8%). in california: the opioid-involved overdose death rate for latinos in california nearly doubled between 2016 and 2019 (2.59 to 5.07 per 100,000). prescription opioids have contributed to the majority of latino overdose deaths in california since at least 2006. while the rate was stable for a decade, it increased by 138% between 2015 and 2019 (1.57 to 3.75 per 100,000). fentanyl-involved overdose deaths increased 35-fold between 2013 and 2019 (from 0.08 to 2.82 per 100,000), and fentanyl replaced heroin as the second most-involved drug in overdose deaths in 2018. methamphetamine-involved overdoses appear to be increasing and may overtake heroin in coming years. when the data is broken down by county in california, the impacts are even harsher. the research found that the overdose rates in lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada and mendocino counties were significantly higher than the state or national average. simply looking at state-level statistics has historically not shown the full extent of harm. the brief outlines key policy recommendations that should be considered in order to mitigate the consequences of the overdose crisis and its impacts on latino communities in california and more broadly. some of the recommendations include: authorizing overdose prevention programs in california at the state and local level, especially where the overdose rates are high such as lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada, and mendocino counties and other vulnerable communities; promoting federal, state, and local legislation to decriminalize personal possession of small amounts of drugs while expanding access to substance use and health services; supporting federal action to make medication for addiction treatment for opioid use disorders (mat), especially methadone and buprenorphine, more accessible by removing the x waiver requirements for prescribing buprenorphine; increasing access to naloxone and mat through private insurance and the state’s drug medi-cal program, including requiring both doctors to co-prescribe and pharmacists to co-dispense naloxone to latino patients with opioid prescriptions; increasing local funding and prioritization of community-based health services and mobile naloxone distribution for people at risk of opioid-related harms, especially in latino vulnerable communities and in high-risk counties; expanding county and city authorized syringe service programs, which are vital access points for naloxone, and fentanyl testing strips with a special focus in lassen, lake, san francisco, nevada and mendocino counties; increasing spanish-speaking staff, including front-line personnel, in harm reduction and syringe exchange programs that are able to connect directly with community members and increase trust within the latino community for harm reduction organizations; partnering with existing and new efforts to relaunch a latino-centric approach and community education campaign on the safe use of opioids and overdose training programming, including the use of naloxone at the county and state level. the full brief and complete list of policy recommendations can be found here.

            "article-content": "new york, ny – a new report released today by the drug policy alliance and the public science project at the graduate center, cuny, inequitable marijuana criminalization, covid-19, and socioeconomic disparities: the case for community reinvestment in new york, shows deep racial disparities and economic impacts in marijuana arrests across the state of new york. four specific case studies document how, despite regional differences, people of color in new york city, new rochelle, syracuse, and buffalo are consistently over-represented in marijuana arrests, and areas with the highest marijuana arrest rates also tend to have proportionally larger populations of color, according to the report. across all cities, there were also higher covid-19 positivity rates among the high marijuana arrest zip codes compared to the low marijuana arrest zip codes. “the enforcement of marijuana prohibition has devastated communities across new york state, primarily communities of color and low-income communities. there have been more than 800,000 arrests for low-level marijuana just in the last 25 years alone in new york, with extreme racial disparities – despite data showing similar rates of use and sale across racial and ethnic populations,” said melissa moore, new york state director, drug policy alliance. “in light of this new report, new york has the opportunity to pass the most ambitious marijuana legalization bill in the country, setting the national model for marijuana legalization by centering reinvestment, equity, and justice within our comprehensive reform. let’s get this done right.” in each city, selected to represent different regions, as well as economic, educational, and racial diversity within the state, the average poverty rate was significantly higher among the high marijuana arrest zip codes and the high marijuana arrest zip codes consistently have nearly half the median household income of the low marijuana arrest zip codes – except for new rochelle, where the disparity is even greater. the average percentage of families receiving snap (supplemental nutrition assistance program) in high marijuana arrest zip codes was at least three times greater than in low marijuana arrest zip codes. in addition, every high marijuana arrest zip code had both lower rates of home ownerships and lower median home values than low marijuana arrest zip codes. in buffalo, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest zip codes is 68 times higher than that of the low arrest zip codes, and there were 3 times as many marijuana arrests of black people as there were of white people. in syracuse, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest zip codes is 8.8 times higher than that of the low arrest zip codes and there were 4 times as many arrests of black, asian, and native american people as there were of white people between 2010-2020, with black people comprising 80% of all marijuana arrests. in new rochelle, the arrest rate in the high marijuana arrest zip code is 7.5 times more than the low arrest zip code and black people comprise 45.8% of all marijuana arrests between 2018-jan 2021 despite being 20.1% of new rochelle’s population. in nyc, the average marijuana arrest rate among the high marijuana arrest precincts is 15 times higher than that of the low marijuana arrest precincts. in marijuana arrests between 2010 and august of 2019, there were 8 times as many arrests of black and latinx people as there were of white people. the extreme racial disparities in new york’s marijuana arrest crusade, as detailed in the case studies in this report, are the result of targeted criminalization and structural racism – and the same factors that have driven the marijuana arrest crusade have also resulted in generational wealth impacts. now, as this report shows, there are also extreme disparities in the impact of covid-19 in the same neighborhoods. “legalizing marijuana cannot be done justly in new york without an adequate plan for atonement for the devastation caused to black and brown people during the decades-long war on drugs,\" said stanley fritz, political director at citizen action of new york. \"this report makes clear the link between being a person of color, economic status and mass criminalization. the consequence for our community is disproportionate deaths, infection rates, joblessness and housing insecurity during the pandemic. legislators will miss the mark to pass truly equitable legislation if they do not vote on the mrta.\" “decades of criminalization during new york’s marijuana arrest crusade have impacted people’s ability to secure housing, employment, and higher education, further exacerbating challenges marginalized communities faced before the pandemic and compounding efforts to survive amid the covid-19 crisis. the same communities targeted by the war on drugs are the ones with the least access to health care right now, the ones grappling with decades of the economic toll from criminalization, with low wages, unstable housing, and the ones losing jobs and loved ones at the same time. the structural factors at play are wholly intertwined – and they cannot be ignored any longer,” according to the report’s foreword. legalization provides an opportunity to invest a significant portion of marijuana tax revenue in the communities that bore the worst of marijuana criminalization and are now deeply impacted by covid-19. both the drug policy alliance and the public science project at the graduate center, cuny support the comprehensive marijuana reform and taxation act (mrta), which is the gold standard reform bill in the legislature. it provides strong community reinvestment and social equity provisions, comprehensively addresses prior criminalization, and has a balanced governance structure for the office of cannabis management. \"at a time when our government must find ways to reduce placing people in confined spaces because of the pandemic, police find ways to target marijuana arrests in vulnerable people of color neighborhoods. this is insanity. stop criminalizing people of color. pass the mrta!\" said juan cartagena, president & general counsel, latinojustice prldef “our ability to support the health of minority communities who’ve suffered disproportionately from cannabis criminalization, as well as our ability to create businesses and jobs within the cannabis industry, is an opportunity that should not be squandered. additional research from the national institutes of health shows high levels of trauma and ptsd among african-american people in urban areas, and if we were to focus specifically on the trauma and ptsd of those incarcerated for marijuana crimes, those numbers would skyrocket. new york must pass legalization that addresses these lifelong impacts,” said adrian adams, ed.d., minorities for medical marijuana. \"this report is simply an empirical recognition of what black and brown people across nys have known for years,\" said jawanza james williams, director of organizing from vocal-ny, \"the only appropriate response to this reality is the immediate legalization of cannabis through the mrta, with robust economic and social reinvestment into the communities most harmed; anything, short of that is at best racist by negligence, and a willful disregard of black lives.\" “it is often misconstrued that the war on drugs was 'failed,' yet we know all too well that it has been intricately designed to result in ways that have funneled black and brown and indigenous new yorkers into the carceral state. in syracuse - a city with the highest concentrated poverty among blacks and latinos nationwide, one of the most segregated school borders in nys, and with an underfunded school district - as all across the state, this war has disproportionately destroyed families and communities of color, fulfilling its intended and designed outcome. the era for race neutral policies to solve racially biased ones is over! the only way to remedy the harm of marijuana prohibition is to design for racial justice at the core. new york has an opportunity to do right by the communities that have been devastated by the war on drugs, and the mrta is an important step towards achieving those goals,” said yusuf abdul-qadir, syracuse police accountability and reform coalition. “these findings reveal how stark and concentrated the disparities are in communities of color,” said dr. brett stoudt, associate professor in the psychology doctoral program at the cuny graduate center and associate director of the public science project. “we need comprehensive legislation like mrta now more than ever because covid-19 has only served to heighten the severity of this deeply entrenched and structural precarity.” "

            "article-content": "santa fe, nm – with the senate tax, business and transportation committee voting in favor of cannabis legalization, emily kaltenbach, senior director for resident states and new mexico for the drug policy alliance, released the following statement: “house bill 12, the only cannabis legislation centered in social justice—putting new mexico families before big business—emerged as a favored bill in the senate, rightly indicating the state’s priorities for legalization. of the amendments made to the bill in the tax committee was one that increases the plant count for microbusiness licenses, which will inevitably lead to a more equitable and diverse marketplace and encourage local small businesses involvement in the industry. with only one more committee to vote on the measure before the full senate takes up the bill, cannabis legalization in new mexico has a clear path to the governor’s desk. and though sb 288—another legalization bill that does not include any social justice and equity provisions or public health protections, and continues to perpetuate the criminalization of new mexicans—was also passed out of committee, new mexicans have made it abundantly clear that, while they are excited to make marijuana legalization a reality in the state, repairing the damage done by the drug war is non-negotiable.” as new mexico considers the end of cannabis prohibition, any legislation that moves forward in new mexico should be comprehensive and contain these key provisions: equity in the new marketplace allow individuals with prior cannabis convictions to work in the new cannabis industry and to apply and receive a license. create a microbusiness license that would be given priority to be licensed first, creating an opportunity for small new mexico businesses to enter the marketplace while requiring other licensing fees to be scaled on the size of the business. require the state to create a social and economic plan to encourage diversity in licensing. authorize the executive to enter into intergovernmental agreements with indian nations, tribes, and pueblos regarding the implementation and compliance in connection with legalization. protections for the use of cannabis prohibit police from stopping and searching an individual or vehicle based on the smell of cannabis alone. no denial of public benefits or health care based on cannabis use or a positive cannabis drug test. prohibit prior cannabis convictions to bar anyone from licensure or employment of any kind. conduct allowed under the new law shall not in itself constitute grounds for intervention, removal or placement into state custody of a child; denial of custody or visitation; and, presumption of neglect of child endangerment. community reinvestment invest a significant portion of revenue generated by cannabis sales back into communities most harmed by unfair enforcement of cannabis laws through the creation of a community reinvestment fund. one-time allocation from cannabis sales to fund an upgrade to the state’s criminal justice data system to allow for automatic expungement and resentencing of past cannabis convictions. protecting medical cannabis patients invest a portion of cannabis revenue into a subsidy fund to support low-income medical cannabis patients. eliminate grt on medical cannabis sales. protecting the public’s health fund a public education campaign that educates the community about the potential harms of use and educates adults on responsible use. limit advertising and marketing and include packaging restrictions to the greatest extent possible to restrict exposure to minors. reducing criminalization automatically expunging records of people with past cannabis convictions and resentencing and releasing people who are currently incarcerated, on probation, parole, or under supervision for cannabis convictions. create a reasonable penalty structure for remaining and new penalties. create civil fines instead of criminal penalties where appropriate. allow personal cultivation (home grow) of a small number of plants for recreational use. background in december, 2020, the u.s. house of representatives passed the marijuana opportunity reinvestment & expungement (more) act that frames cannabis reform as a racial justice and equity mandate. the more act was the first piece of comprehensive cannabis reform legislation that decriminalizes marijuana—and the only one centered in reparative justice—to pass either chamber of congress. arizona and new jersey passed legalization proposals this past year that center equity and racial justice as well, with new york considering similar legislation in their current session. nearly three out of four new mexicans approve of cannabis legalization with provisions in place to ensure tax revenue is reinvested back into communities, including 94% of democrats, 93% of independents and 46% of republicans.

            "article-content": "santa fe, nm — last night, the new mexico house passed house bill 123 (rep. d. armstrong) by a 47-20 vote with bipartisan support, authorizing overdose prevention programs (opps), also known as safer consumption spaces or supervised injection facilities, as a critical public health tool to combat overdose deaths and provide a bridge to health care, substance use treatment and social supports. the bill authorizes municipalities and counties to establish overdose prevention programs that meet guidelines prescribed by the new mexico department of health. the legislation also provides legal protections for the programs and participants. numerous people with lived experience and organizations, including the new mexico hospital association, bold futures, new mexico first, and the new mexico criminal defense lawyers association, have expressed support for the bill. overdose prevention programs are facilities where people can legally consume previously purchased illicit drugs under the supervision of trained staff who help make their use safer, respond immediately to overdoses, and connect them with medical care, drug treatment, and social services. deborah armstrong, nm representative and chair of the house health and human services committee: “new mexico’s rate of death by drug overdose is heartbreaking and unacceptable. overdose prevention programs are a proven, compassionate way to save lives and fight addiction. drug overdose is a public health crisis and we need innovative policies to help individuals, families and communities recover from addiction.” emily kaltenbach, senior director of resident states and new mexico, drug policy alliance: “with this bill, new mexico has the opportunity to provide people access to critical services that can save lives and shift its approach away from the failed punitive policies of the war on drugs. overdose prevention programs are an essential component of a continuum of care for people who use drugs. these services will reach the people who need them most, move them off the streets, protect their dignity and health, and provide a pathway to drug treatment and other vital services. new mexico has a long history of leading in innovative harm reduction, and this is an important moment to set an example for other states and do it again.” background overdose prevention programs (opps) or supervised consumption services (scs) are provided in legally sanctioned facilities that allow people to consume pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of trained staff and are designed to reduce the health and public order issues often associated with public drug consumption. facility staff members do not directly assist in consumption or handle any drugs brought in by clients, but are present to provide sterile injection supplies, answer questions on safe injection practices, administer first aid if needed, and monitor for overdose. this is particularly pertinent to fentanyl because the onset of overdose is rapid and waiting for an ambulance may mean death or permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen. opp staff also offer general medical advice and referrals to drug treatment, medical treatment, and other social support programs. there are approximately 120 scs currently operating in ten countries around the world (australia, canada, denmark, france, germany, luxembourg, the netherlands, norway, spain and switzerland) – but none in the united states. opps can play a vital role as part of a larger public health approach to drug policy. they are intended to complement – not replace – existing prevention, harm reduction, and treatment interventions. supervised consumption spaces are designed to reduce the health and societal problems associated with drug use. such facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about reducing the harms of drugs, health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. some offer counseling, drug treatment, and other services. extensive research on these facilities consistently demonstrates a variety of cost-saving public health benefits including reducing public nuisance associated with illicit drug use, such as public drug use and improper syringe disposal; reducing overdose deaths; increasing access to drug treatment; and reducing risk behaviors for hepatitis c and hiv. learn more at drugpolicy.org/scs.

            "article-content": "washington, d.c. – in response to the u.s. house of representatives passing the george floyd justice in policing act of 2021 without addressing concerns from the advocacy community, maritza perez, director of the office of national affairs for the drug policy alliance (dpa), released the following statement: “while we understand the urgency to pass police reform at the federal level, we can’t do it in a way that merely provides a veneer of justice while sacrificing real systemic change at the most opportune moment to achieve it. unfortunately, because house leadership chose to fast-track last year’s bill, rather than addressing advocates’ and community members’ concerns, that’s exactly the compromise they have made, and today’s vote solidified those failings. the house-passed bill fails to provide for real reform and accountability and we oppose this bill in its current form. notably, this bill fails to fully address issues like police militarization and quick-knock raids, policing practices that are disproportionately used against people of color in drug investigations. while the bill places restrictions on programs that facilitate the transfer of military equipment to local police departments, it does not outright put an end to such programs. and while this bill prohibits no-knock warrants for drug cases, it does not outlaw quick-knock raids which can be just as deadly. moreover, the bill continues to fund police departments and the war on drugs, rather than shift resources to education, housing, harm reduction services, and other infrastructure that strengthens communities and increases public safety. the seriousness of this moment demands real reform, and the house bill is sadly a far shot from that. we call on the senate to rectify these shortcomings by working alongside advocates and community members to craft a comprehensive police reform bill that will hold law enforcement accountable, protect our communities and ensure dignity and respect for black, latinx and indigenous lives.” "

            "article-content": "santa fe, nm — last night, the new mexico house passed house bill 123 (rep. d. armstrong) by a 47-20 vote with bipartisan support, authorizing overdose prevention programs (opps), also known as safer consumption spaces or supervised injection facilities, as a critical public health tool to combat overdose deaths and provide a bridge to health care, substance use treatment and social supports. the bill authorizes municipalities and counties to establish overdose prevention programs that meet guidelines prescribed by the new mexico department of health. the legislation also provides legal protections for the programs and participants. numerous people with lived experience and organizations, including the new mexico hospital association, bold futures, new mexico first, and the new mexico criminal defense lawyers association, have expressed support for the bill. overdose prevention programs are facilities where people can legally consume previously purchased illicit drugs under the supervision of trained staff who help make their use safer, respond immediately to overdoses, and connect them with medical care, drug treatment, and social services. deborah armstrong, nm representative and chair of the house health and human services committee: “new mexico’s rate of death by drug overdose is heartbreaking and unacceptable. overdose prevention programs are a proven, compassionate way to save lives and fight addiction. drug overdose is a public health crisis and we need innovative policies to help individuals, families and communities recover from addiction.” emily kaltenbach, senior director of resident states and new mexico, drug policy alliance: “with this bill, new mexico has the opportunity to provide people access to critical services that can save lives and shift its approach away from the failed punitive policies of the war on drugs. overdose prevention programs are an essential component of a continuum of care for people who use drugs. these services will reach the people who need them most, move them off the streets, protect their dignity and health, and provide a pathway to drug treatment and other vital services. new mexico has a long history of leading in innovative harm reduction, and this is an important moment to set an example for other states and do it again.” background overdose prevention programs (opps) or supervised consumption services (scs) are provided in legally sanctioned facilities that allow people to consume pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of trained staff and are designed to reduce the health and public order issues often associated with public drug consumption. facility staff members do not directly assist in consumption or handle any drugs brought in by clients, but are present to provide sterile injection supplies, answer questions on safe injection practices, administer first aid if needed, and monitor for overdose. this is particularly pertinent to fentanyl because the onset of overdose is rapid and waiting for an ambulance may mean death or permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen. opp staff also offer general medical advice and referrals to drug treatment, medical treatment, and other social support programs. there are approximately 120 scs currently operating in ten countries around the world (australia, canada, denmark, france, germany, luxembourg, the netherlands, norway, spain and switzerland) – but none in the united states. opps can play a vital role as part of a larger public health approach to drug policy. they are intended to complement – not replace – existing prevention, harm reduction, and treatment interventions. supervised consumption spaces are designed to reduce the health and societal problems associated with drug use. such facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about reducing the harms of drugs, health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. some offer counseling, drug treatment, and other services. extensive research on these facilities consistently demonstrates a variety of cost-saving public health benefits including reducing public nuisance associated with illicit drug use, such as public drug use and improper syringe disposal; reducing overdose deaths; increasing access to drug treatment; and reducing risk behaviors for hepatitis c and hiv. learn more at drugpolicy.org/scs.

            "article-content": "new york, ny – in response to the washington state supreme court declaring the state’s felony drug possession law unconstitutional, theshia naidoo, managing director of the department of legal affairs, released the following statement: “yesterday, the washington supreme court struck down the state’s felony drug possession statute, declaring it unconstitutional. this provides the legislature a unique opportunity to completely rethink the state’s approach to drug possession. though the court’s decision is based on narrow grounds and legislators could decide to fix the constitutional defects of the drug possession statute, the decision underscores the need for comprehensive drug policy reform that centers health and compassion by highlighting the harshness of the war on drugs and criminalizing drug possession, especially in communities of color. read in its full context, the court is issuing a clarion call for bold legislative action this decision is a perfect dovetail to the drug decriminalization bill moving through the legislature, which has already passed out of committee. we urge legislators to immediately consider this bill and the benefits it would bring, including expanded health, harm reduction and recovery services, rather than re-enacting the harmful criminal penalties of the past that have resulted in extreme racial disparities, record drug overdoses, and countless lives ruined. oregon has already shown us in the most recent election that decriminalization is not only politically viable, but incredibly popular -- as measure 110, which decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use and provided increased access to services -- passed by a 17 point margin. washington should follow suit and provide people with the services they need, rather than the burden of a criminal record they are forced to carry throughout their lives.” "
